### Basic JavaScript: Iterate with JavaScript While Loops
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/iterate-with-javascript-while-loops

## Intro to JavaScript: 
**Iterate with JavaScript while loops**
```
var ourArray = [];
var i = 0;
while(i < 5) {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
``` 
> Note: I have completed this challenge but the system not Accepting the answer.
**Nesting for Loops**
- I face this challege on my job interview and common one. Fortunately, this time I was able to get enough information to really tackel this question.
**Generate Random Whole Numbers within Range**
- There was some challenges on Random number ex. ```Math.floor(Math.random()* (max - min + 1)) + min```. I created a function and returns a random number plus and minues or equal to generate. it was difficult finding the right math methods for some of questions asked. 
**Use parseInt Function with Radix**
- First time working Radix, but I have came across with ```parseInt()```. I learned that Radix is second arrugument which specify the number in string(convertToString)
**Intro to ES6:**
- I have some challeges on Es6 pretty new to me. In the past i have learn like Import, export, promise and let, const. 
  But it makes me to dig deep on new stuff and learn basic of ES6. For example: I learned adding contents to current file ```import * as ``` syntax.
